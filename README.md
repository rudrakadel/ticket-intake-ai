## 🤔 What Is This?

**AI Support Assistant Pro** is a full-stack intelligent ticket intake system that makes support engineers actually look forward to Monday mornings.  *(Okay, maybe not Monday mornings, but definitely fewer "where is that doc?" moments.)*

This system:
- Reads support tickets (subject + description)
- Understands customer emotions (yes, including rage)
- Searches through historical tickets like Sherlock Holmes with a CS degree
- Generates human-quality responses using local LLMs
- Detects knowledge gaps in your KB
- Sends rich alerts to Slack when things go sideways

The best part? It runs entirely on **Ollama** — no cloud costs, no privacy leaks, and no judgment for your messy ticket descriptions.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

This system is built as part of an **AI-Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support & Ticket Resolution**.

It targets real-world support problems:
- Slow response times due to manual searching in outdated docs
- Inconsistent answers for similar tickets
- Hidden knowledge gaps that only show up when customers complain
- Lack of proper insights into ticket patterns, sentiment, and bottlenecks

By combining **LLMs**, **semantic search**, and **analytics**, this project turns your support workflow into a smart, continuously learning engine.

---

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Smile

### 🔍 Smart Ticket Understanding
- **Dual Input Processing** Reads both **subject** and **description** for complete context.
- **FAISS-Powered RAG** Uses **sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** + **FAISS** to find similar historical tickets.
- **LLM-Generated Responses** Uses local Ollama models (e.g., `llama3.2`, `mistral`) to generate customer-ready replies.
- **Automatic Classification** Assigns:  
  - Priority: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`  
  - Category / type  
  - Topics & tags

---

### 😊 Sentiment & Emotion Detection
- Integrates **TextBlob** (when available) to compute sentiment polarity.
- Converts raw polarity into labels like:  
  - Positive  
  - Neutral  
  - Negative
- Negative sentiment can **boost ticket priority** (because angry users shout loudest).

---

### 🧩 Knowledge Gap Detection

When the AI cannot find good matches in your historical data, it raises a **Knowledge Gap** instead of hallucinating.

Example stored structure:
```json
{
  "flagged": true,
  "gap_reason": "No good retrievals",
  "kb_fill_text": "",
  "filled_by": "",
  "filled_at": null
}
````

Admins can later fill this gap from the **Admin Portal**, and the system:

  - Saves the KB fill text with who filled it and when
  - Reuses this text in **future retrievals** for similar tickets

**Teach once → AI remembers forever.** 🧠

-----

### 🏷️ Intelligent Topic Tagging

The app uses regex-based topic extraction and metadata to detect common topics like:

  - Login Issues
  - Payment Problems
  - Technical Bugs
  - Account Management
  - Feature Requests
  - Refund Requests

These topics show up in both the ticket view and analytics.

-----

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support

  - **Language Detection** via `langdetect` (if installed)
  - Tickets store a `language` field
  - Admin analytics allow filtering by language to see trends per locale

-----

### 🛠️ Admin Portal

A dedicated `admin_app.py` provides an **Admin UI** to:

  - Open / Close tickets
  - Fill knowledge gaps with proper audit trail
  - Re-run LLM generation (where applicable)
  - Filter and search tickets based on:
      - Status
      - Priority
      - Sentiment
      - Text search
      - Date ranges

-----

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard

Because managers love charts more than raw logs:

  - Priority distribution (High / Medium / Low)
  - Sentiment distribution (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  - Ticket volume over time
  - Topic frequency / heatmap
  - Time-to-close distributions (in the admin portal)

-----

### 🔔 Slack Notifications

Real-time alerts with rich context and action buttons:

  - High priority tickets
  - Negative sentiment tickets
  - Knowledge gap flags

Slack messages include:

  - Subject
  - Status, priority, category
  - Sentiment & language
  - Suggested reply preview
  - Ticket ID & requester email (if provided)
  - Buttons:
      - **Open in Admin** - **Mark Open** - **Mark Closed** - **Fill Gap**

-----

### 🎫 Short Ticket IDs

Instead of dumping raw UUIDs on agents, the system generates **short, friendly ticket IDs** (using secure random tokens) that look like:

```
abc123xyz
```

Easy to paste in Slack, easy to filter in admin, easy to remember (kind of).

-----

### 📧 Requester Email Tracking

Each ticket optionally stores the **requester email**, letting you:

  - Track who raised which ticket
  - Later notify them when a knowledge gap is filled
  - Improve support follow-up flows

-----

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Here’s the flow in simple terms:

1.  User submits a ticket via Streamlit UI
2.  System embeds subject + description using `sentence-transformers`
3.  FAISS retrieves top-k similar tickets from historical data
4.  LLM (via Ollama) synthesizes a suggested reply
5.  System annotates:
      - Sentiment
      - Priority
      - Category
      - Topics
6.  Ticket + metadata are saved into `conversation_history.json`
7.  Slack receives a formatted alert (if configured)
8.  Admin uses the portal to refine, fill gaps, and close tickets

```

Open: `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 6: Start the Admin Portal

In another terminal:

```bash
streamlit run admin_app.py --server.port=8502
```

Open: `http://localhost:8502`

-----

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Build the FAISS Index

1.  Open the main app: `http://localhost:8501`
2.  Use the sidebar to upload a CSV with historical tickets
3.  Click **"Build FAISS Index"**
4.  Wait for embeddings + index build to complete (progress indicators will show)

**Expected CSV columns:**

```
subject
body
answer
type
queue
priority
language
version
tag_1 ... tag_8 (optional)
```

### 2️⃣ Analyze a Ticket

1.  Enter **Subject**
2.  Enter **Description**
3.  Optionally provide **Requester Email**
4.  Click **"Retrieve & Analyze"**

The system will:

  - Detect sentiment (😊 / 😐 / 😟)
  - Detect language
  - Tag topics
  - Retrieve similar tickets
  - Generate a suggested reply using LLM
  - Assign priority and category

### 3️⃣ Review Results

You will see:

  - **Sentiment & Polarity** - **Language** - **Topics / tags** - **Retrieved Context** (top similar tickets)
  - **Priority**: High 🔴 / Medium 🟡 / Low 🟢
  - **Category / queue** - **Suggested Reply** (editable)
  - **AI latency / response time**

### 4️⃣ Admin Actions

From the **Admin Portal** (`admin_app.py`), you can:

  - Open / Close tickets by ticket ID
  - Fill knowledge gaps with KB text
  - Filter tickets by status, priority, sentiment, and text
  - View analytics for historical tickets and performance

-----

## 🕳️ Knowledge Gap Detection

### How It Works

When the AI cannot answer confidently (e.g., no good retrievals from FAISS, or very short input), it flags a knowledge gap:

```json
{
  "flagged": true,
  "gap_reason": "No good retrievals",
  "kb_fill_text": "",
  "filled_by": "",
  "filled_at": null
}
```

### Triggers

  - No similar tickets (low similarity scores)
  - Ticket description too short or incomplete

### Filling Gaps

Admins can fill gaps via:

  - **Admin Portal**: Search by ticket ID, then fill `kb_fill_text`
  - **Slack Deep-Link**: Click "Fill Gap" in the Slack notification → opens admin page with that ticket

Once saved:

  - The `kb_fill_text` is stored with `filled_by` and `filled_at`
  - Future similar tickets automatically incorporate this KB text during retrieval, improving quality over time.

-----

## 🛠️ Admin Portal

### Key Features

  - **Ticket Status Management** Mark tickets as `Open` or `Closed`.
  - **Gap Filling Interface** Complete KB gaps with a structured text input and audit info.
  - **Deep-Link Support** Admin portal parses query parameters like:
    ```
    ?ticket_id=abc123xyz&action=open
    ?ticket_id=abc1cxyz&action=close
    ?ticket_id=abc123xyz&action=fill_gap
    ```
  - **Analytics View** Basic plots (powered by Seaborn + Matplotlib):
      - Priority distribution
      - Sentiment by status
      - Time-to-close histograms

-----

## 📊 Analytics Dashboard

### Metrics

  - **Total Tickets** - **Average AI Response Time**
  - **Count of High Priority Tickets**
  - **Count of Negative Sentiment Tickets**

### Charts

  - Priority distribution (High / Medium / Low)
  - Sentiment distribution (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  - Ticket timeline (per day)
  - Topic frequency
  - Time-to-close histogram

-----

## 🔔 Slack Integration

### Setup

1.  Create a Slack Incoming Webhook:  
    https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
2.  Add the webhook to `.env`:

<!-- end list -->

```env
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=[https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL](https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL)
```

### Notification Triggers

Slack alerts are sent when:

  - A **High Priority** ticket is created
  - A **Negative Sentiment** ticket is detected
  - A **Knowledge Gap** is flagged

### Example Message

```
AI Support Assistant Pro: 🔴 High | 😟 Negative (-0.6) | Category: Payment

Subject: Charged twice for subscription
Priority: High
Category: Payment
Sentiment: Negative (-0.62)
Language: EN
