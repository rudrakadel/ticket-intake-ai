Subject: Application server down - urgent

Hi Team,

Our production server went down at around 3:20 PM today. The dashboard shows a 500 Internal Server Error, and none of the APIs are responding.  
Please investigate this on priority â€” this is affecting all live user transactions.

Error log snippet:
2025-10-08 15:21:03 ERROR ConnectionRefused: Could not connect to database

Thanks,
