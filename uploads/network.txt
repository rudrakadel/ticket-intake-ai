Subject: High latency detected in east-region servers

Team,

We are observing unusually high latency from the east-region VMs (average > 1200ms).  
Ping tests to the internal load balancer are timing out intermittently. Could this be due to the recent firewall rule update?

Please check network routes and confirm.

Regards,  
Network Monitoring Team
