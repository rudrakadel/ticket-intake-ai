I've checked both Windows notification settings and Slack preferences - everything looks correct. More concerning, the mobile app on my Samsung Galaxy S23 crashes every time I try to open a channel with images or files. The app just freezes for 5-10 seconds and then closes completely. I've already tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the app but no luck. This is affecting my ability to stay updated on urgent project messages from my team.
